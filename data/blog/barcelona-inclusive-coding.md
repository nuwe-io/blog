# Mobile World Capital Barcelona, Creu Roja and NUWE connect digital talent with technology companies

  

## A hackathon has provided 30 people in vulnerable conditions the opportunity to demonstrate their talent in front of companies in search of junior Backend and Frontend profiles.
  
**This initiative is part of the BCN Inclusive Coding programme, which aims to train and connect 10,000 digital professionals with the digital corporate environment over the next 10 years.**Â 


The Mobile World Capital Foundation, through its Barcelona Digital Talent programme, together with Creu Roja Barcelona and NUWE have organised the **first social hackathon**, Hackathon BCN Inclusive Coding, in a hybrid format. The initiative, aimed at people at risk of social exclusion, has had the participation of **30 candidates, accompanied by 10 mentors**, who have been able to demonstrate their skills in front of companies such as NTT Data, Babel and CaixaBank, which are in the process of searching for junior profiles of Backend and Frontend.

The 30 participants, who were previously selected from among more than 140 registered participants, are in vulnerable conditions and have reached the digital sector thanks to training programmes aimed at groups at risk of social exclusion in centres such as Factoria F5. Most of the participants are students of free high-quality training in programming, specifically Full Stack development.

During the hackathon, participants were organised into four groups of five people who worked as a team to solve a **social challenge** based on five **Sustainable Development Goals**: ending poverty, quality education, gender equality, decent work and economic growth and reducing inequalities. The mentors assessed and accompanied the teams during the process. Once the day was over, the participating companies received the CVs to be able to follow up on the profiles through selection processes.

Thus, with the **Hackathon BCN Inclusive Coding**, not only all the participants were offered the opportunity to have direct contact with the recruiting companies, but also to share their **Hard & Soft Skills** results with all of them. On the other hand, **the winning team will win a ticket to the Mobile World Congress 2023.**

 

**BCN Inclusive Coding, pursuing inclusion in the development of digital talent**

The initiative, which took place at the Creu Roja headquarters, is part of the BCN Inclusive Coding project, a professional reorientation programme aimed at people in vulnerable conditions to promote job placement through training in digital skills in demand by companies. **It aims to train and connect 10,000 people at risk of exclusion with the digital corporate environment over the next 10 years.**

Its promoters assure that BCN Inclusive Coding arises from the need to connect people in situations of vulnerability, 26% of the population of Catalonia, with one of the sectors with the greatest capacity to generate quality jobs. And the figures confirm this: the demand for digital talent has grown by 80% in the last two years in Catalonia as a result of the digitisation of companies. In fact, in Barcelona alone, one of the most important digital hubs in Europe, there are hundreds of technology companies and start-ups that need new talent to boost their digital projects. Offering these vulnerable groups the opportunity to access specialised, quality training programmes is an opportunity both for them and for companies looking for talent.

  

The first social hackathon has concluded with great satisfaction on the part of participants and companies, who have seen numerous opportunities for talent to incorporate into their digital teams. Initiatives like this represent a real opportunity to move into the future by taking advantage of the positive impact of technology, without leaving anyone behind.
