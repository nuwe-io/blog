On **January 21, 22 and 23rd, 2022**, more than **1,500 women** from more than **50 countries** (including Spain, the United States, Australia and Peru) participated in the online event T**he International FemHack**: the first **female-only Hackathon**, accompanied by educational **conferences** presented by women leaders from the technology sector.

The event was managed and coordinated by **NUWE** from **Aticco Workspaces**'s installations in **Barcelona**.

The Hackathon (or programming competition) was designed for all levels of expertise, and the contenders could perform in **Web**, **Mobile** and **Data Development** modalities. The trials consisted of an **individual** and a **group challenge**, in which participants from different modalities had to unite and cooperate to achieve the best score.

The event also included a series of conferences, available for all audiences, presented by women leaders in the technology sector. The lectures were being transmitted live during the days of the event. The themes of the talks were very varied, although all of them evoked the same emotions in the listeners: inspiration, female references and motivation. The speakers were the following (in order of appearance): **Celia Lozano Grijalba** (Bosonit), **Idoia Martí i Aluja** (AllWomen), **Imma Calvo** (Google), **Cristina San Jose** (Banco Santander), **Esther Cid Rodríguez** (Tipscool), **Montse Salvany** (T-Systems), **Clara Lapiedra** (Aula Magna Business School), **Laura Rodríguez Gómez** (Novartis), **Anna Schlegel** (Procore), **Anemari Fiser** (CodeOp), **Belen Lorente-Galdos** (Nespresso), **Sian Davies** (Ironhack), **Naiara Chaler** (Aticco), **Kasia Adamowicz** and **Alinne Shedid Harnen** (Assembler Institute of Technology).

What made the event even more special was the active participation of the leading companies **Novartis** and **Banco Santander**. These firms sponsored the event and participated actively in the Hackathon as recruiters of female talent. Moreover, NUWE set up an online meeting area between the FemHack participants and the companies via the virtual simulation platform **Gather**.

In addition to numerous **prizes** for the **winners** of each modality of the Hackathon (such as a 23.8" Huawei screen), the prestigious programming schools **Ironhack**, **CodeOp**, **4Geeks Academy** and **Assembler Institute of Technology** offered **scholarships** for their courses and masters to all the participants of the event who were interested. Assembler Institute of Technology provided a 100% scholarship for the Software Development master's degree to one of the winners of the Hackathon.

With The International FemHack event, NUWE's goal is to **increase the representation of women in the technology sector, boost female hiring and create female references for the new generations.**

Thus, in one weekend, **women from diverse parts of the world broke the algorithm of gender inequality in the technology sector and will continue to do so (and we too) until it is no longer necessary to organize events like The International FemHack.**
