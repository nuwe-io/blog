Now that the year is ending, **NUWE TEAM** has had a thought about what we have achieved and done during this year. How has this year been for us? Have we achieved our 2022 targets? The other day we sat down and asked ourselves these questions, and we could say that we are very happy with everything we have achieved.

That's why we want to show you our **NUWE wrapped 2022** 🙌🏻
