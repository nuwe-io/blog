# NUWE Categories 


As you already know, at **NUWE** we organise recruiting and competitive style **Hackathons**, and at the same time, we hold our **gamification platform** so you can expand your portfolio, learn new methods and meet people and companies in the tech sector. Whether in the Hackathons or on the gamification platform itself, we offer a variety of **modalities** so that **recruiters** and **developers** can choose which ones suit them best.

  

So, here is the **list of modalities that you will find in NUWE**!:

  

### Frontend

The Frontend is the speciality in charge of making the website stunning, hiding all the possible internal chaos 😬. The Frontend Developer works on everything from the structure of the page to the colours, backgrounds, images... In other words, Frontend Developers are the artists of the team and the ones who work on the visual aspects of the project 👩🏻‍🎨.

### Backend

The Backend is for the heroes and heroines without a cape who prefer to work hidden in the shadows 😶‍🌫️. A Backend Developer is there to modify and fix any hiccups that may occur in the project's workflow, making sure it runs smoothly, and avoiding stressful situations for colleagues and customers. Thanks for everything, Backends ✊🏻

### Data Science

If you are a freak about analysing information in a rigorous and scientifically based way, you chose the red pill by specialising in Data Science 💊🐇. The role of the Data Science Developer is to analyse big data sources, extract information from them, comprehend them and draw conclusions on a firm basis. You are born researchers! 🔎

### Mobile Dev

Also called App Developers, you design, develop and implement the applications for those devices called phones that we all carry around with us all the time, and that we use more than 4 hours a day (yes, crazy 🤯). In other words, your true goal is to rule the world and people through their mobile screens 😈.

### Cybersecurity

The Cyber Developer is that person who works in the darkness of their room, by the light of four screens, and lines of code are reflected in the lenses of their glasses. Nobody knows it, but he/she is saving the world from a universal hack... OK, we've gone a bit too far here, but you guys are so cool! Pd: Friendly reminder to cover the webcam of your laptops 🥶.

### Multidisciplinary

In addition to the above-mentioned modalities, in **NUWE** we are a multidisciplinary **team of Developers**, constantly evolving and learning new programming languages to keep up with the needs of recruiting companies and our users 💚.

That's why we have recently launched challenges with **Cross-Platform React** ⚛️, and **we are looking forward to using more modalities and languages in our Hackathons and challenges**! 🚀
