# The Schneider Electric Hackathon: A Schneider Electric and NUWE's hiring programming competition that fights climate change\*\*

### The Schneider Electric Hackathon took place online on Saturday, 21th May, and NUWE coordinated it from Barcelona\*\*

On **21th May 2022**, more than **140 programmers** competed in the **Schneider Electric Hackathon**. The **nationwide (Spain)** competition was coordinated **online** by **NUWE** from **Barcelona**, and carried out as an initiative of the company **Schneider Electric** to **meet and recruit technological talent**.

The **Hackathon** (or programming competition) was suitable for **trainee and junior levels**, and contestants could compete, as a **group**, in **Data Science** and **Cybersecurity** modalities. The challenges included **environmental themes against climate change**, and had to be overcomed to achieve the best score. The time score was around 10:00 am to 11:59 pm on 21th May to submit the challenges.

What took the biscuit to the event was the setting up by NUWE of a **meeting space** between the **participants aspiring to find a job** and the **Schneider Electric team** through a **virtual world** created especially for the event. This virtual world ensured the **active participation of the Schneider Electric recruiting team**, as their intention with the Hackathon was to get to **meet directly the technological talent participating in the competition**, as well **promote technological development in the fight against climate change**.

Thus, with the Schneider Electric Hackathon, **the competitors with the best score will not only be guaranteed to be hired by Schneider Electric**, but will also **win numerous prizes worth 5,000 euros**. The winners will be announced internally by Schneider Electric and NUWE.
