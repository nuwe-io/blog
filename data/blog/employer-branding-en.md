# In which company would you like to work?

## Do you already have the answer? Well, the company that first came to your mind is developing its Employer Branding perfectly 👌🏻

If we go by the definition on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employer_branding): An **employer brand** is branding and marketing, the entirety of the **employment experience**. It describes an employer's reputation as a place to work and their employee value proposition, as opposed to the more general corporate brand reputation and value proposition to customers.

In other words, **Employer Branding is how you, as a company, are viewed by your customers, your employees, and your potential future candidates.** Something not to be taken lightly, don't you think? 🙌🏻

It should be said that this concept is relatively new: in **Spain**, it started to be used in **2008** with the beginning of the crisis and the need for companies to retain their talent. But now, in **2022**, is when it is **booming** and becoming increasingly important. Why? Well, here are some of the various reasons:

### 1\. The entry into the market of the “digital and hyper-connected generation”

Increasingly (if not already), the **organization of companies** and their **connectivity** with their employees is becoming more **digital**. And this is not only related to one of the consequences of the **pandemic**, but also to the entry into the market of that generation that used to spend their evenings in front of their Windows 95 screens and send buzzes to their friends via Messenger: **the Millennial generation**.

### 2\. Checkmate to the corporate status quo

The Millennial generation is also famous for its **high ethical and social values**, and for bravely supporting the importance of **mental health**. Thus, this generation is the antithesis of the obsolete corporate culture, full of hierarchies, burnouts and conservatism so far imposed by their predecessors. No more having to wait until your boss leaves the office to finish your working day 🙅🏻

### 3\. Demographic changes

Millennials are causing a **drop in the birth rate**, either because they simply don't want to have children, or because they haven't enough resources due to their low salaries (this is a topic for another article 😅). This means a **decline in the working population** in the coming years, which will mean that there will not be enough young people to fill the needed jobs. In other words, **companies will be fighting among themselves to recruit and retain talent**.

With this, we must bear in mind that the demand for technological profiles will **boost** in the years to come, and the Millennial generation is full of these profiles. So, **how do we get the new generations to come to our company or, even more difficult, how do we get them to stay with us?**

You can find Millennials taking a stand for a social cause on **Twitter**, posting their CV on **LinkedIn** or showing pictures of their beloved pets on **Instagram**. If you want to define an **Employer Branding Strategy** to attract and retain the talent of this generation, one idea would be to **adapt to their digital ecosystem and evolve with them**.

However, if you are an **HR professional** who not only provides a **good image of your company through social media**, but also you **care about your company's employees** and want them to work in a **healthy environment and conditions**, as well as wanting your company to be the preferred choice for potential candidates for these reasons, it means that **you are already making an effort to improve your Employer Branding. Congratulations, you are changing the world!** 👏🏻
