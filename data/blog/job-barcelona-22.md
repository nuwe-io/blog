### Camp Nou is no longer just for football, but also for programming leagues.

### The final of the IT JUNIOR Hackathon of JOBarcelona'22 was held on Tuesday 31 May by JOBinplanet and NUWE at the Llotja Presidencial del Camp Nou.

  
Barcelona, 7 June 2022

**40** programmers competed in the **IT JUNIOR Hackathon** on **Saturday 28th May 2022** at the **Llotja Presidencial del Camp Nou (Barcelona)** with **NUWE** and **JOBinplanet** within the framework of **JOBarcelona**, the Congress of Employment and Professional Guidance for University Students, Junior Graduates and CFGS. 

The purpose of **JOBinplanet** and **NUWE** with this event was to **connect tech** talent with the mentoring companies and sponsors of the event, which were **JOBinplanet**, **Telefónica**, **Adidas**, **Estrella Damm**, **Werfen**, **Diputació de Barcelona** and **Freepik**.

  

The **Hackathon** was organised using a **hybrid model**, with the **pre-selection phase online** and the **final phase on-site**. Participants had to choose between **Front-end**, **Back-end**, **Data Science** or **Business Analytics** modalities to compete. The **challenges**, related to the b**usiness sector**, had to be overcome **individually and in groups**. The **online phase** lasted **from 25 April to 18 May**, and the **on-site phase** lasted for the entire day on **31 May**.

  

Thus, with the **IT JUNIOR Hackathon**, the **winners** of the on-site phase not only won **prizes from the sponsoring companies**, but also detailed **reports** on the results of their **Hard & Soft Skills** challenges and the opportunity to **network exclusively with the Talent Acquisition teams of the sponsoring companies**. In addition, **all participants**, whether selected or not, were given a **Hard Skills report**.
